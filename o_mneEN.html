      <h3>About me</h3>

      <h6>
        When I was little, I went to a after school club where we programmed
        robots from lego. At that time, the film Matrix also came to theaters. I
        was very fascinated by how you can create a world by writing different
        characters. But I was led in a different direction. They were martial
        arts. Eventually, I started doing historical fencing that has held me
        since 2007. The group I joind in focused on historical theater and mass
        medieval battles. There I learned to work in a group. Because if you
        want to win the battle, you have to work together. In 2017, I finally
        got to do what I really enjoy in fencing. And these are duels with a
        two-handed sword (HEMA - Historical European Martial Art). I started
        fencing because of books and games about the Witcher. I consider myself
        an active player of PC games. In 2019, I became actively interested in
        working on fireshows, which I have been doing so far. My first real job
        was paid from sale. Although I still worked part of the working day in
        simple database programs (eg Siebel 7 adapted for Telekom). I enjoyed
        working with databases and I enjoyed learning in it until I could do the
        tasks they knew how to do in the back office. Finally, the wind of fate
        drove me to the railroad. I became a train driver. But it didn't
        completely fill me either. But in the end, I got a chance to change my
        life. I was fired for the corona crisis. It was time to think about what
        to do next. I only enjoyed two things to do. Either fencing (but it
        can't be employed) or creating something. Because I enjoyed modifying pc
        games, I decided to learn some programing language. And that led me to
        learn the programing of websites.
