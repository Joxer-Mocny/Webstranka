      <h3>About me</h3>

      <div class="Omne"><p>
        As a little boy, I went to the school club, where we programmed
        robots from lego. At that time, the film Matrix also came to theaters. I
        was very fascinated by how you can create a whole world by writing
        different characters. I started thinking about programming thanks to my
        hobby - I consider myself an active PC player. I enjoyed modifying my PC
        games with mods, so programming came naturally. Gradually, I got to
        creating websites. During life I went through various professions. I
        worked in sales or as train driver. They all gave me something, but
        since they weren't fulfilling me, I decided to move on. In addition to
        programming, I do fencing, specifically dueling with a two-handed sword
        - HEMA (Historical European Martial Art) and historical theater. Since
        2019 I am also actively working with a fire stuff and I also
        learn how to blow fire as part of a fire show.
